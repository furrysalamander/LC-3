# LC#3

An implementation of the LC-3 in C#!

Now featuring a skeleton assembler.
All features work fairly well, just needs work on the user interface.

Roadmap:

Overhaul the form so that all of the boxes and buttons work correctly.

Saving and restoring memory dumps

Saving and loading programs

Other things as requested...

Anyone that wants to help is welcome to!
